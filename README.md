# Ansible Role: Prometheus

Prometheus is an opensource monitoring solution that gathers time series based numerical data. It is a project which was started by Google’s ex-employees at SoundCloud.

To monitor your services and infra with prometheus your service need to expose an endpoint in the form of port or url. For ex:- {{ localhost:9090 }}. The endpoint is HTTP interface that exposes the metrics.

## Requirements

There is no particular requirment for running this role. As this role is platform independent for centos 6 or 7 and ubuntu 14 or 16. The only dependency for centos 6 is libselinux python and we have included that as well.
The basic requirments are:-
- Centos/Ubuntu Server
- Python should be installed on the target server so that ansible can perform task
- libselinux-python should be available on Centos 6 so that ansible can connect to it

## Role Variables
The role variables are defined in the **defaults**. So there is not so many variables you just have to pass the prometheus version.

```yaml
# vars file for prometheus
prometheus_version: "2.3.2"
prometheus_ip: "0.0.0.0"
prometheus_port: "9090"
```
You can define any prometheus version that you want to install on your server.

|Variable | Description|
|---------|------------|
|prometheus_version | Prometheus will be downloaded from github releases, so you have to define version in [defaults](https://gitlab.com/oosm/osm_prometheus/tree/master/defaults) |
|prometheus_ip | IP of the server on which prometheus will expose its UI |
|prometheus_port | Port no. of server on which prometheus should listen |

## Dependencies
None :-)

## Example Playbook

Here is an example for the main playbook

```yaml
---
- hosts: prometheus
  user: root
  roles:
    -  prometheus
```
Here We are using root as an user but you can use different user, For that you just have to make become value true. Something like this:-
```yaml
---
- hosts: prometheus
  user: test-user
  become: true
  roles:
    -  prometheus
```

For inventory you can create a host file in which you can define your server ip, For example:-
```
[prometheus]
10.1.1.100
```

You can simply use this role by using this command
```shell
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```
